Impact of the Civil War on the Rwandan Economy 

2. Description: 

Adjusted Net National Income between the period 1970 and 2000 were collected(source World Bank databank). Using the matplot function, the net income based on year was plotted.

3. Method: Qplot and Matplot functions were used to plot the data. Matplot function has been used only for learning purposes, and advanced plotting functions are obviously a better choice.

4. Insights:

It was observed that in 1991, the growing national income saw a drastic drop, and once again saw a massive drop in 1994. The Civil War in rwanda was restarted by Paul Kagame in 1991 and the world-famour Rwandan Genocide took place in 1994, which may have had a huge impact on the economy.
