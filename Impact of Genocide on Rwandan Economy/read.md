1. Impact of the 1994 Genocide on the Rwandan Economy


Adjusted Net National Income between the period 1970 and 2000 were collected(source World Bank databank).
Using the matplot function, the net income based on year was plotted.

It was observed that in 1991, the growing national income saw a drastic drop, and once again saw a massive drop in 1994. 
The Civil War in rwanda was restarted by Paul Kagame in 1991 and the world-famour Rwandan Genocide took place in 1994, 
which may have had a huge impact on the economy. (Source-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide)
