# Analysis of Low Income Groups 

# Analysis 1 - Gambia is the best country in this group
#             that has highest progression to secondary school
#           There was a slight increase in ratio from 2012 to 2014
#Getting info on low income group countries (result= 10)

a

# Getting info on the country with highest enrollment value in 2012
#Result = Gambia
a[a$X2012==max(a$X2012),]


# Analysis 2  - Guinea in 2012 was notably below all other 
#               countries in this group
#               but showed significant progress in 2013
#               possible indication of installation of educational programs
b<-secondarydata[secondarydata$Income.Group=="Low income",]
b
# Getting info on the country with lowest secondary enrollment value in 2012

b[b$X2012==min(b$X2012),]
#Result is Guinea 



# Analysis of High Income Groups


# Analysis 1 : 
d<-secondarydata[secondarydata$Income.Group=="High income",]
d
# observing minimum value in 2012 -shows no significant change
d[d$X2012==min(d$X2012),]
# observing minimum value in 2013 -Saudi Arabia shows significant change
# value in 2012 is 100%, but in 2013 is 92.43%
# There is not much information available on the cause
d[d$X2013==min(d$X2013),]


#Analyzed the 2007 - 2013 data for Saudi Arabia's 
# Progression to secondary school rate for women
#  In 2007 97.1
#  In 2011 and 2012 100%
#  In 2013 92.4%. 
# Either the 2011 and 2012 could be incorrect statistics,
# Or the educational system took a drastic measure
# which may have caused a sudden drop in enrollment rates
# In which case, there would have been studies on the same.
